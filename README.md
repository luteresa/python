We have now gone through the various phases in the process of writing a software. These
phases can be summarised as follows:
1. What (Analysis)

2. How (Design)
3. Do It (Implementation)
4. Test (Testing and Debugging)
5. Use (Operation or Deployment)
6. Maintain (Refinement)
A recommended way of writing programs is the procedure we have followed in creating the
backup script: Do the analysis and design. Start implementing with a simple version. Test
and debug it. Use it to ensure that it works as expected. Now, add any features that you
want and continue to repeat the Do It-Test-Use cycle as many times as required.

Remember:
Software is grown, not built. -- Bill de h√ìra
